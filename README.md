The Monterail's Rules
=====

Following document contains development guidelines for [Monterail.com, LLC](http://monterail.com).

## General

1. Leave the campground cleaner than you found it.
2. [Configure your editor](https://gist.github.com/4451806) to automatically strip trailing whitespaces.

## Git

### Use [`git up`](https://github.com/aanand/git-up) tool

especially if you're not experienced with git. It keeps the commit history clean.

```bash
gem install git-up
git config --global git-up.bundler.check true
git config --global git-up.bundler.autoinstall true
git config --global git-up.fetch.all true
git config --global git-up.rebase.arguments --preserve-merges
```

If you're comfortable with Git commands, use [`git config --global branch.autosetuprebase always`](http://blog.aplikacja.info/2010/11/git-pull-rebase-by-default/)

Follow the rules described in our [Git flow](GIT.md)

## [Rails](RAILS.md)

## Ruby
* [avoid rescuing StandardError and Exception](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10048173/why-is-it-bad-style-to-rescue-exception-e-in-ruby#answer-10048406)

## HTML

### Use consistent class names and markup for HTML components

For basic ones, use [twitter bootstrap 2](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) conventions.
For example don't use `<div class="crumbs">` for breadcrumbs instead of `<ul class="breadcrumb"></ul>`. This also concerns layout, forms, buttons, flash messages, navigation and others.

If possible, document new markup proposals in our [styleguide](https://github.com/monterail/boilerplate-rails).

For proper forms markup, install the [formtastic-bootstrap](https://github.com/mjbellantoni/formtastic-bootstrap) gem.
