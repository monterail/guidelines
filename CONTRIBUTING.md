# Contributing

According to [this issue](https://github.com/monterail/rules/issues/25) we agreed to:

* Declare if he/she wants to participate in issues tagged with given word, for example #ruby or #css. Then all issues / pull-request would be tagged appropriately.
* If so, he/she would be obligated to comment on issue or at least give +1 or no opinion comment for example until week after issue has been created.
* The idea is subscribed persons would be obligated to comment. We will mention them in such cases.
* Final decision for merging is for CTO.
* It's of course possible for non-declared person to participate. That list would help us determine if issue is ready to be accepted or it needs more discussion / time (for example if everyone would vote "no opinion").
* If you have **no opinion** do not hesitate to tell that. At least you will leave a note that you read an issue.

## Merging

You can simply prepare [closing commits](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages) if issue is clear for every who participated in the discussion. Otherwise transform issue into [pull-request](https://github.com/github/hub#git-pull-request) which allows to verify agreement on the topic.
