# Use consistent class names and markup for HTML components

For basic ones, use [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) conventions.
For example don't use `<div class="crumbs">` for breadcrumbs instead of `<ul class="breadcrumb"></ul>`. This also concerns layout, forms, buttons, flash messages, navigation and others.

If possible, document new markup proposals in our [styleguide](https://github.com/monterail/boilerplate-rails).
